{"0": "The connection between people and plants has long been the subject of scientific research.", "1": "Recent studies have found positive effects.", "2": "A study conducted in Youngstown, Ohio, for example, discovered that greener areas of the city experienced less crime.", "3": "In another, employees were shown to be 15% more productive when their workplaces were decorated with houseplants.", "4": "The engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have taken it a step further changing the actual composition of plants in order to get them to perform diverse, even unusual functions.", "5": "These include plants that have sensors printed onto their leaves to show when they are short of water and a plant that can detect harmful chemicals in groundwater.", "6": "\"We are thinking about how we can engineer plants to replace functions of the things that we use every day,\" explained Michael Strano, a professor of chemical engineering at MIT.", "7": "One of his latest projects has been to make plants glow in experiments using some common vegetables.", "8": "Strano's team found that they could create a faint light for three-and-a-half hours.", "9": "The light, about one-thousandth of the amount needed to read by, is just a start.", "10": "The technology, Strano said, could one day be used to light the rooms or even to turn tree into self-powered street lamps.", "11": "In the future, the team hopes to develop a version of the technology that can be sprayed onto plant leaves in a one-off treatment that would last the plant's lifetime.", "12": "The engineers are also trying to develop an on and off \"switch\" where the glow would fade when exposed to daylight.", "13": "Lighting accounts for about 7% of the total electricity consumed in the US.", "14": "Since lighting is often far removed from the power source â€” such as the distance from a power plant to street lamps on a remote highway - a lot of energy is lost during transmission .", "15": "Glowing plants could reduce this distance and therefore help save energy."}
