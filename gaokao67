{"0": "A build-it-yourself solar still is one of the best ways to obtain drinking water in areas where the liquid is not readily available.", "1": "Developed by two doctors in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it's an excellent water collector.", "2": "Unfortunately, you must carry the necessary equipment with you, since it's all but impossible to find natural substitutes.", "3": "The only components required, though, are a 5' 5\" sheet of clear or slightly milky plastic, six feet of plastic tube, and a container - perhaps just a drinking cup - to catch the water.", "4": "These pieces can be folded into a neat little pack and fastened on your belt.", "5": "To construct a working still, use a sharp stick or rock to dig a hole four feet across and three feet deep.", "6": "Try to make the hole in a damp area to increase the water catcher's productivity.", "7": "Place your cup in the deepest part of the hole.", "8": "Then lay the tube in place so that one end rests all the way in the cup and the rest of the line runs up - and out - the side of the hole.", "9": "Next, cover the hole with the plastic sheet, securing the edges of the plastic with dirt and weighting the sheet's center down with a rock.", "10": "The plastic should now form a cone with 45-degree-angled sides.", "11": "The low point of the sheet must be centered directly over, and no more than three inches above, the cup.", "12": "The solar still works by creating a greenhouse under the plastic.", "13": "Ground water evaporates and collects on the sheet until small drops of water form, run down the material and fall off into the cup.", "14": "When the container is full, you can suck the refreshment out through the tube, and won't have to break down the still every time you need a drink."}
