{"0": "Fifteen years ago, I took a summer vacation in Lecce in southern Italy.", "1": "After climbing up a hill for a panoramic view of the blue sea, white buildings and green olive trees, I paused to catch my breath and then positioned myself to take the best photo of this panorama.", "2": "Unfortunately, just as I took out my camera, a woman approached from behind, and planted herself right in front of my view.", "3": "Like me, this woman was here to stop, sigh and appreciate the view.", "4": "Patient as I was, after about 15 minutes, my camera scanning the sun and reviewing the shot I would eventually take, I grew frustrated.", "5": "Was it too much to ask her to move so I could take just one picture of the landscape?", "6": "Sure, I could have asked her, but something prevented me from doing so.", "7": "She seemed so content in her observation.", "8": "I didn't want to mess with that.", "9": "Another 15 minutes passed and I grew bored.", "10": "The woman was still there.", "11": "I decided to take the photo anyway.", "12": "And now when I look at it, I think her presence in the photo is what makes the image interesting.", "13": "The landscape, beautiful on its own, somehow comes to life and breathes because this woman is engaging with it.", "14": "This photo, with the unique beauty that unfolded before me and that woman who \"ruined\" it, now hangs on a wall in my bedroom.", "15": "What would she think if she knew that her figure is captured and frozen on some stranger's bedroom wall?", "16": "A bedroom, after all, is a very private space, in which some woman I don't even know has been immortalized.", "17": "In some ways, she lives in my house.", "18": "Perhaps we all live in each other's spaces.", "19": "Perhaps this is what photos are for: to remind us that we all appreciate beauty, that we all share a common desire for pleasure, for connection, for something that is greater than us.", "20": "That photo is a reminder, a captured moment, an unspoken conversation between two women, separated only by a thin square of glass."}
